	I investigate the inverse problem posed by \cite{grindrod2009}.
	Given a number of states of the graph $G$, I wish to create a model based upon birth and death rates on which to predict future states of $G$.
	This model uses a range-dependent graph, where each vertex is assigned an integer that determines its distance from other vertices.
	This problem is quadratic in nature and has already been solved using specific eigenanalysis in \cite{grindrod2009}.
	However, this solution takes time on the order of $O(n^3)$.
	In my investigation, I use techniques that we learned in CS 6958 to solve the inverse problem with greater speed and precision.
